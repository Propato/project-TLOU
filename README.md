# The Last of Us Project

This is a website project about the series 'The Last of Us', inspired by the design of streaming services. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an immersive user experience. The aim of this project is to review and strengthen my knowledge of these programming languages, while also improving my skills in web development.
